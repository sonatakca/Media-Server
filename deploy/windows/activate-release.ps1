.SYNOPSIS
Makes a staged release the one the services run, and puts the previous one
back if it does not come up.

.DESCRIPTION
Steps 3 to 9 of docs/deployment-model.md. The ordering is the point: every
step before the junction switch is reversible by doing nothing, and the switch
itself is a single rename.

The invariant this script exists to keep:

    the database's schema must be current
            BEFORE
    code that requires it is activated

and its less obvious corollary — the migration must be run by the *new*
release's migrator, because the new release is what ships the migration files.
So step 4 runs node from the staged release directory, not from whatever is
currently serving.

Rollback restores the code, not the schema. Migrations are additive across a
rollback by design; a migration that removes what the previous version reads
would make this script's recovery path a lie.

<#
What to go back to is not always a previous release. The first activation
replaces a git checkout, and a rollback that only knew about junctions would
have nothing to say — it would leave the services pointed at a release that
just failed to start.

So rollback restores the two things the switch changes: where `current` points,
and what the services call their working directory. Recording the second from
the registry covers the checkout case and the junction case with one path.
