/**
 * Produces one adaptive package, from probe to activated pointer.
 *
 * The lifecycle is the same shape as the legacy processor's and for the same
 * reason: a package is built in an isolated work directory, measured, validated
 * as a whole, and only then promoted and pointed at. Nothing ever writes into a
 * directory a playback session might currently be reading, and a failed run
 * leaves the previously active package — legacy or adaptive — exactly as it was.
 *
 * The unit of *work*, however, is no longer the whole package. The timeline is
 * cut into nominal five-minute epochs, each encoded by one FFmpeg process that
 * reads and decodes the source once and produces every rung of the ladder for
 * that stretch. An epoch that finishes is validated, manifested and renamed
 * into place, and from that moment it is immutable: a crash, a cancel, an
 * unplugged drive or a restarted server costs at most the epoch that was
 * running. Assembly then joins those epochs into the final renditions by
 * copying bytes — no decoder, no encoder, not even a remux — so the recovery
 * story does not cost a second transcode at the end.
