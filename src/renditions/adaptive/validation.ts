/**
 * Strict validation of a packaged adaptive rendition set.
 *
 * A package is either provably correct or it is not activated. There is no
 * middle state, because the failure mode of a nearly-correct adaptive package
 * is not an error message — it is a viewer whose picture freezes for a few
 * seconds every time the ladder moves, with nothing in any log to say why.
 *
 * Two rules shape the checks below:
 *
 *  - Nothing is trusted because the encoder was asked for it. Every claim in
 *    the manifest is re-derived from the packaged bytes and compared.
 *  - Error messages name the media id, the rendition, the stage and the
 *    measured discrepancy, and contain no absolute filesystem path, because
 *    they are surfaced to operators through interfaces that also reach clients.
