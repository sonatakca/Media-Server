 * The durable checkpoint format, and the rules that decide where a movie is cut.

 * A package used to be one transaction: one FFmpeg process read the source
 * once, decoded it once, and produced the whole ladder. That is the right shape
 * for throughput and the worst possible shape for recovery — losing the drive
 * at 00:52 of a 02:30 title threw away fifty-two minutes of encoding, because a
 * half-written ladder has no subset anybody can use.
 *
 * The timeline is now cut into nominal five-minute epochs. Each epoch is still
 * one FFmpeg process with one decode feeding every rung, so the shared-decode
 * advantage is kept intact; what changes is that an epoch which finishes is
 * *durable*. Worst-case loss is therefore one epoch rather than the whole
 * title.

 * is still readable: a change to where the cuts fall does not make an already
 * published title unplayable, and must not withdraw it from delivery.
