/**
 * A source with a hole in it, packaged end to end.
 *
 * This is the reproduction of a real failure, reduced to a fixture. A Seagate
 * Expansion volume holding a 02:30 title developed an unreadable physical
 * region; the epoch covering 00:50:00–00:55:00 produced 123.290s of its 299.966s
 * and FFmpeg reported `Read error at pos. 10074169063` followed by
 * `Error during demuxing: Input/output error`. Raw reads against the device
 * confirmed the bytes are gone: a megabyte either side reads in hundredths of a
 * second, the region itself returns EIO after thirty-five.
 *
 * The behaviour under test is what the pipeline does about that. Nothing here
 * relaxes a tolerance, and the epoch that could not be read is never accepted
 * at its short length — it is replaced, at exactly the length the plan gave it,
 * so the film's own timeline survives and 00:55:00 is still at 00:55:00.
 *
 * Everything is real except the disk: a real FFmpeg, real fragments, real
 * validation, and a runner that fails exactly the reads the platter failed.
