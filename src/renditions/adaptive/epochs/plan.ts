/**
 * The immutable epoch plan.
 *
 * Written once, before any encoding, and read back on every restart. Two
 * properties matter and both are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - It is *deterministic*. The same source bytes, adaptive profile and
 *    timeline policy always produce the same boundaries, so a job that dies and
 *    restarts computes exactly the epochs it already has on disk rather than a
 *    slightly different set that cannot be joined to them.
 *  - It is *exact*. Boundaries are carried as rationals in the source's own
 *    time base, never as accumulated floating-point seconds, because a
 *    two-and-a-half-hour title has thirty joins and a fraction of a millisecond
 *    lost at each one is a visible drift by the end.
