/**
 * Telling a source that cannot be read from an output that cannot be written.
 *
 * Both produce `Input/output error`, both can end the same FFmpeg process, and
 * exactly one of them is a reason to replace five minutes of a film with black.
 * The difference is never in the errno and never in the exit code — it is in
 * *which side* of the transcode reported it, which FFmpeg does say and which
 * nothing in this pipeline used to read.
 *
 * Two further facts shape this file, both learned from a real failure on a
 * Seagate volume whose platter had a bad region:
 *
 *  - The exit status cannot be trusted on its own. A demuxer that gives up
 *    mid-file may still let the muxer finalise, and `progress=end` arriving is
 *    a statement about the reporting pipe rather than about the media. So the
 *    evidence is read from stderr whatever the process returned, and it is read
 *    *before* the duration validator, which would otherwise blame the encoder
 *    for a short epoch and spend the retry budget re-encoding a hole.
 *  - What is kept must be safe to show. The tail is bounded and every absolute
 *    path is reduced to a file name, because this text travels into the job
 *    record and from there to a browser.
