/**
 * The resumable encoder.
 *
 * One loop, one rule: for every epoch in the plan, either a valid checkpoint
 * already exists and is reused, or one FFmpeg process reads the source once,
 * decodes it once, and produces every rung of the ladder for that five minutes.
 * Nothing else in the system decides what to encode — the CLI and the server
 * job both come through here, so "why did it re-encode that" has one answer.
 *
 * The loop is written so that every exit is safe. An abort, a pause that turns
 * into a stop, a vanished volume and a failed validation all leave the
 * completed epochs untouched and at most the running one to redo.
