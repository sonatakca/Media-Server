/**
 * Final assembly, without a video encoder.
 *
 * This is the step the whole architecture is judged on. Five hours of
 * checkpointed encoding followed by another full transcode would be worse than
 * no checkpointing at all, so assembly never decodes a frame and never invokes
 * FFmpeg. It copies bytes.
 *
 * That is possible because of two properties the epoch encoder deliberately
 * arranges. Every epoch is muxed with its own timeline starting at zero, which
 * makes each rendition's initialisation segment byte-identical across epochs —
 * checked here rather than assumed — so one initialisation serves the whole
 * title. And every epoch knows the exact source presentation time of its first
 * frame, so moving its fragments onto the global timeline is one addition to
 * each `tfdt` rather than a re-timestamping pass.
 *
 * What comes out is a single-file byte-range CMAF rendition indistinguishable
 * from one a single uninterrupted encode would have produced, with no
 * discontinuity tag, no second initialisation segment, and no seam a player has
 * to be told about.
