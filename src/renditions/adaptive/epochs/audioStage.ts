/**
 * Audio, as its own recoverable stage.
 *
 * Audio used to ride along in the same FFmpeg process as the video ladder,
 * which was free while a package was one transaction and is wrong now: a
 * failure encoding a soundtrack would take eight video renditions with it, and
 * a video epoch that had to be redone would re-encode audio it had already
 * produced. Sound is cheap — minutes against hours — so it is built once for
 * the whole title and checkpointed on its own.
 *
 * The consequence that matters is stated plainly because it is the whole point:
 * audio failing never invalidates a video epoch, and a video epoch failing
 * never re-encodes audio.
