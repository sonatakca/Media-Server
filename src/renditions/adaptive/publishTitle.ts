 *  - **Files of `COPY_CHUNK_BYTES * 3` (3 MiB) or less**: every window is read,

 *    Playlists, manifests and build records are all far below this.

 *    size mixed into the digest. Verification I/O is capped at 3 MiB a side
 *    whether the file is 4 MiB or 400 GB.

 * falls outside all three windows is not detected here. That is a deliberate
 * trade against reading the whole package twice, and it is pinned by a test in
 * `destinationVerification.test.ts` so it stays deliberate. What surrounds it —
 * deep validation of the package on scratch before publication, playlist byte
 * ranges re-checked against the destination file they address, and every
