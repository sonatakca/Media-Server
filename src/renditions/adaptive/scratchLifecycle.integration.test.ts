/**
 * The storage lifecycle, measured against real FFmpeg output on two volumes.
 *
 * These tests exist because the claims that justify the scratch pipeline are
 * all claims about which disk holds which bytes at which moment, and none of
 * them can be checked by reading a call site:
 *
 *  - The encoder reads the source where it lies and writes nowhere near it.
 *  - Nothing reaches the media volume until the package has proven itself.
 *  - A publication that is interrupted resumes the copy instead of repeating
 *    the transcode, which for a real title is the difference between minutes
 *    and hours.
 *  - Scratch is released only once the destination has been proven.
 *
 * The two roots are ordinary sibling directories rather than real mounts. That
 * is enough: every property under test is about paths, ordering and what
 * survives a failure, and none of them becomes true or false because the two
 * directories happen to share a device.
