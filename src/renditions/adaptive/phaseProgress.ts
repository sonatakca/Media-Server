/**
 * What every phase after the video encode reports about itself.
 *
 * The video encoder has always had rich feedback because FFmpeg hands it a
 * measured timeline four times a second. Everything after it — audio, assembly,
 * verification, publication — did real work for minutes at a time and reported
 * nothing but its own name, so a job that had finished encoding looked stalled
 * for the rest of its life.
 *
 * The shapes here are the fix, and they follow one rule: every number is
 * measured from work that has actually completed. Bytes are bytes the process
 * wrote, checks are checks the validator finished, media time is FFmpeg's own
 * `out_time`. Nothing is derived from a wall clock ticking toward a guess.
 *
 * They are also the wire format. These objects travel from the worker through
 * the live-progress file to the browser, so they hold only serialisable values:
 * rendition ids, counts and byte totals, never an absolute path and never a
 * Node object.
