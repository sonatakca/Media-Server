 * The incident these are written from: a USB-attached drive returned `EIO` from
 * the SCSI block layer while its mount stayed and its directory metadata
 * answered instantly. Every availability check passed. After a forced restart a
 * job left `running` was requeued within seconds, FFmpeg went back at the same
 * region, and the machine had to be powered off a second time.
 *
 * So the property under test is not "does it notice a failure" — the old code
 * noticed several — but "having noticed, can anything short of a person undo
 * it". No test here touches a real volume; the whole point of the state machine
 * being pure is that this file cannot.
