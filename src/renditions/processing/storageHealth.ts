/**
 * Whether a volume may be worked against at all, and what it takes to say yes
 * again once the answer has been no.
 *
 * The watchdog beside this file answers a narrow question — is the root there,
 * readable, and still the same device — and that question was enough while the
 * only failure being modelled was a cable pulled out of a healthy disk. It is
 * not enough for the failure that motivated this file.
 *
 * What happened: a USB-attached drive began returning `EIO` from the SCSI block
 * layer. The mount stayed. Every path still resolved. `stat` and `readdir` on
 * the media root answered instantly, because directory metadata was cached and
 * intact. By every test the watchdog knows how to run, the storage was *fine* —
 * so after the machine was force-restarted, a job left `running` by the unclean
 * shutdown was requeued within seconds of login, FFmpeg went back at the same
 * region, and the kernel re-entered a retry sequence that took the whole
 * machine down a second time.
 *
 * The lesson is that availability and health are different questions, and only
 * one of them can be answered by looking. Health has to be *remembered*: it is
 * inferred from what failed, it outlives the process that observed it, and it
 * is cleared by a person rather than by a poll. This file is the memory and the
 * rules; the storage a rule is about is never touched from here.
 *
 * Deliberately pure. Everything that reads a disk, writes a row, or spawns a
 * process lives above it, so the policy can be exercised exhaustively without a
 * volume to exercise it against — which is the only way this could be tested at
 * all, the drive that produced the evidence being the one thing no test may go
 * near.
