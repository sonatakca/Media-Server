 * Which volume a Windows path is on — the Windows half of `StorageIdentityProbe`.

 * manager will answer for. Windows has the same shape of problem and the same
 * shape of answer: the path is resolved to its **volume** first, and only then
 * is the volume asked what it is.
 *
 * The resolution step here is pure and happens in this process. That is a
 * deliberate security property as much as a testing one: the only value that
 * ever reaches PowerShell is a single drive letter that has been matched
 * against `^[A-Za-z]$`, so a media path — which is attacker-influenced in the
 * sense that it comes from a filesystem — is never interpolated into script
 * text. See `buildVolumeQuery`.
 *
