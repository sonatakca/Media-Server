/**
 * Which volume this actually is — as opposed to which path it turned up at.
 *
 * Every identity check in this system was a string comparison on a mount path,
 * and a real incident showed what that is worth. A disk image containing a
 * partition named `Expansion` was mounted for tests while the failed physical
 * `Expansion` HDD was unplugged. `mount` reported
 * `/dev/disk4s1 on /Volumes/Expansion (exfat)`, every path-based check agreed
 * this was the dangerous drive, and it was in fact a 2.9 GB synthetic image
 * holding `E2E Title (2026)/video/{144p…720p}.mp4`.
 *
 * The failure runs both ways and both are unacceptable:
 *
 *  - **False positive.** A test image mounted at the quarantined path inherits
 *    the quarantine, so the E2E suite stops for a fault on hardware it has
 *    never touched.
 *  - **False negative, and far worse.** A quarantine recorded against a failing
 *    USB drive is *satisfied* by mounting any volume at the same path. Plug in a
 *    different disk, or attach an image, and the recovery check passes — which
 *    would hand back a green light for storage nobody has repaired.
 *
 * So identity is what the volume *is*: a UUID that survives remounting and
 * rebooting, and a medium that says whether it is physical external media, an
 * internal disk, a network mount, or a file pretending to be a disk. The path
 * is where it happens to be today and is never, on its own, evidence.
 *
 * Nothing here reads media. The probe asks the OS for volume metadata, is
 * injected everywhere it is used, and is never called in a loop.
