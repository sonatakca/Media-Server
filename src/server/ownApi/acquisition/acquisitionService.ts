/**
 * Getting a chosen release into SABnzbd, exactly once.
 *
 * The hard part is not sending the NZB; it is not sending it twice. A response
 * lost after SABnzbd accepted the file looks identical, from here, to one that
 * never arrived — and the naive repair, sending it again, is precisely how a
 * download appears in the queue twice.
 *
 * The answer is a name only this acquisition would ever use, written to the
 * database *before* anything is sent, and given to SABnzbd as the job name. A
 * lost response is then not a question about what happened; it is a question
 * about what SABnzbd currently holds, and that has an answer.
 *
 * So: persist `submitting`, look before sending, and never treat "I do not
 * know" as "it did not happen".
