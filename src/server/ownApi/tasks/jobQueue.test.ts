/**
 * What a job is allowed to carry between the process that queues it and the
 * worker that runs it.
 *
 * A payload is typed `Record<string, unknown>`, so the compiler has nothing to
 * say about it, and `JSON.stringify` is happy to turn things that are not JSON
 * into `{}` rather than complain. The combination is how a forgotten `await`
 * became lost content: `titleRoot` was a Promise, it reached the database as an
 * empty object, the worker saw no usable destination and fell back to the
 * folder beside the source — which for an episode is the season folder shared
 * with its neighbours.
 *
 * So the queue refuses the payload rather than storing a job that will run with
 * a field silently missing.
