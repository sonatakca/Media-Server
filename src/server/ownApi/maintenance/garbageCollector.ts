/**
 * Removing what Seyirlik left behind and will never read again.
 *
 * Three kinds of leftover, each identified by what owns it rather than by how
 * old it is:
 *
 * - encode workspaces whose job is no longer pending, queued, running or
 *   paused — asked of the database again for each one, immediately before it
 *   goes, so a job retried a moment ago keeps its workspace;
 * - finished downloads nothing will import: a cancelled or superseded
 *   acquisition's, a blocklisted release's, or one whose import completed but
 *   could not remove its source;
 * - temporary folders Seyirlik made for itself and did not get to remove.
 *
 * Age appears only as a race guard. A paused encode's checkpoints may be weeks
 * old and are the most expensive thing on the volume; "older than N days" is
 * exactly the rule that would delete them. Anything this cannot identify as
 * Seyirlik's own is left where it is, because these directories can hold an
 * operator's files too.
