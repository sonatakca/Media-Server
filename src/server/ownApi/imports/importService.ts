/**
 * Carrying out an import, and finding out what happened when it was
 * interrupted.
 *
 * The commit protocol is the whole of this file, and it exists because a
 * filesystem and a database cannot be committed together. The ordering below
 * is chosen so that every point at which the process can die leaves evidence a
 * later process can read and act on without guessing.
 *
 *   1  stage      link, copy or move every source to a name beside its
 *                 destination that only this import would have used
 *   2  remember   record each staged file's identity, while it is still staged
 *   3  declare    write `committing` — before the first activation, never after
 *   4  activate   rename staging to the destination, refusing to replace
 *   5  commit     record each file committed; the unique index decides
 *   6  conclude   write `committed` once every file has been
 *
 * Step 2 is what makes the rest recoverable. A rename preserves a file's
 * identity, so the identity of the staged file *is* the identity the
 * destination will have. A process that restarts inside step 4, with no idea
 * whether the rename happened, can therefore look at the destination and know
 * from one `stat` whether the file there is its own work or a stranger's.
 *
 * Step 3 sits before step 4 for the reason the state machine is shaped the way
 * it is: a crash between them has to look like "this may have happened", and a
 * crash after them must never look like "this never started".
 *
 * Staging is deliberately a separate pass over every file rather than being
 * interleaved with activation. It means the window in which the library is
 * half-written is as short as the renames, not as long as the copies.
