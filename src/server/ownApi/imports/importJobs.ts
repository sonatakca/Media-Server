/**
 * Imports on the existing leased job queue.
 *
 * Not a second background system. The queue already has durable leases,
 * heartbeats, restart recovery and per-lane concurrency, and an import that
 * survives a service restart is exactly what those were built for.
 *
 * Two handlers. One carries a single import as far as it can get; the other
 * sweeps the rows whose filesystem outcome nobody knows. Everything else —
 * retry, backoff, escalation — is a consequence of those two running again,
 * which is what makes the pair safe to re-run at any moment.
