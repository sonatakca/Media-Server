 * Sizes are compared as well as existence, because a truncated media file still
 * opens, still plays, and simply ends early — which is the failure that reaches
 * a viewer with nothing in any log to explain it.
 *
 * Read before a source file is deleted, which is the one action here that
 * cannot be taken back, and when a single title is analysed on demand. It is
 * deliberately not read by the background package index: that sweeps the whole
 * library on a clock, and this is a stat per rendition against a spinning disk.
