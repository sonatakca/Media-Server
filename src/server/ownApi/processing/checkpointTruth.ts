/**
 * What a job may truthfully be told it recovered.
 *
 * The message that motivated this file said:
 *
 *   "Storage is available again; encoding continues from the last durable
 *    checkpoint. Only the five-minute epoch that was interrupted is built
 *    again."
 *
 * It was emitted unconditionally, by a requeue path, immediately after
 * `beginAttempt` had reset `completed_epochs`, `epoch_index`,
 * `protected_seconds` and `encoded_seconds` to zero. So the sentence was not
 * merely optimistic, it was the opposite of the row it sat next to. An operator
 * reading the history saw two hours of protected work described where the
 * canonical state recorded none, and nothing anywhere had looked at a
 * checkpoint to decide either way.
 *
 * The correction is not to soften the wording. It is to *ask the disk*, which
 * is where durable progress actually lives, and to say what it answers. The
 * checkpoint store below has always been trustworthy — an epoch becomes durable
 * by an atomic rename performed after its manifest is written, and validating
 * one re-checks every file it names for presence and size. Nothing consulted it
 * at recovery time.
 *
 * Cheap by construction: one directory listing and a small JSON file per
 * completed epoch. It never opens a media file, which matters because this runs
 * at exactly the moment a volume is least worth exercising.
