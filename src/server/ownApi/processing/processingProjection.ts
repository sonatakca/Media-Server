 * canonical source file, a plan for it, a package on disk, maybe a job — is
 * identical, and is modelled once as `ProcessingTitle`. Series and seasons are
 * containers built around those titles and own no processing state of their
 * own: every count they carry is derived from their episodes.
 *
 * Nothing here opens a media file. The technical figures come from the probe
 * the scanner already persisted, and the package figures from the index that
 * reads manifests on its own clock. That is what lets a library with hundreds
 * of episodes be a database read.
