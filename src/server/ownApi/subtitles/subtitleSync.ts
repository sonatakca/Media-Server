/**
 * Correcting a subtitle that is right about the words and wrong about when.
 *
 * The rest of this subsystem answers "find me a subtitle". This answers the
 * question that comes next and far more often: the subtitle is here, somebody
 * has watched twenty minutes of it, and every line arrives fourteen seconds
 * late. Nothing about that is a search problem — the file is correct, the
 * translation is somebody's work, and the only thing wrong with it is an
 * arithmetic fact about its timeline.
 *
 * Two things are chosen rather than inferred, and both belong to the operator:
 *
 *  - **Which subtitle to correct.** Only a sidecar can be corrected. An
 *    embedded track lives inside the container and moving it would mean
 *    rewriting the film, which is not a subtitle operation; such a track is
 *    offered as a *reference* and never as a target.
 *  - **What to trust instead.** Either another subtitle track — usually the
 *    English one that came with the release and is known to be right — or an
 *    audio track. A reference subtitle is the better signal by a wide margin
 *    when one exists, because it carries one onset per line of dialogue rather
 *    than one per stretch of speech; audio is what is left when it does not.
 *
 * The correction is `time · rate + offset` and nothing more expressive. That is
 * not a simplification of the problem, it is the problem: a subtitle and a film
 * are two clocks, and two clocks differ by where they started and how fast they
 * run. A subtitle that needs more than this — one timed to a different cut —
 * cannot be repaired by moving it, and the confidence figure is what says so.
