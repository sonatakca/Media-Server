/**
 * What Seyirlik means by a subtitle.
 *
 * This is the domain Bazarr occupies today, and the point of writing it out is
 * that Seyirlik should own the *product* question — does this file have the
 * translation somebody wants, and if not, what happened — rather than inherit
 * another program's model of it. Bazarr is a migration reference here and
 * nothing more; none of its internal shapes appear below.
 *
 * Three decisions run through everything else:
 *
 *  - **A subtitle belongs to a video file, not to a title.** A film kept as a
 *    theatrical cut and a director's cut is one item and two files, and a
 *    translation timed to one of them is wrong against the other. The library
 *    already discovers sidecars per source file for exactly this reason.
 *  - **Where a track lives is part of what it is.** An embedded stream and a
 *    `.srt` beside the video answer the same question for a viewer and are
 *    completely different objects to a downloader, a packager and a file
 *    system. Collapsing them loses the distinction at the moment it matters.
 *  - **Authentication is a pause, not a failure.** The provider this was
 *    designed against issues short-lived browser sessions, and a session
 *    expiring mid-search is an ordinary event. A job that fails permanently
 *    because a cookie aged out would teach an operator to ignore the state.
