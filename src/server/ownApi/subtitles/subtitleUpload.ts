/**
 * A subtitle a person hands over, rather than one a provider was asked for.
 *
 * The searching subsystem exists because finding a subtitle is slow, uncertain
 * and worth retrying. None of that is true of a file somebody already has: they
 * know which title it belongs to and which language it is, and they want an
 * answer now. So this is a plain request-scoped operation with an immediate
 * result — no want, no attempt, no state machine, no queue.
 *
 * What it deliberately does **not** do differently is write. The destination is
 * derived by the same storage writer the pipeline uses, from the media file the
 * catalogue id resolves to, so an upload cannot name a path, cannot leave the
 * configured root, cannot clobber a file this system does not own, and lands
 * under the same `<stem>.<lang>[.forced][.sdh].<format>` name the detector, the
 * packager and the player already read.
