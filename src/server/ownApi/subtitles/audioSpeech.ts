/**
 * Where somebody is speaking in an audio track.
 *
 * The aligner needs one thing from audio: the same list of speaking intervals a
 * subtitle gives it for free. Producing that properly is a speech-detection
 * problem, and the tempting answer — bundle a voice-activity model — buys a
 * dependency, a model file and a second runtime for a job that a band-limited
 * energy envelope does well enough, because the aligner does not need to know
 * *whether* a sound is speech. It needs a signal whose loud stretches begin when
 * the dialogue begins, a thousand times over two hours, and film audio obliges.
 *
 * Two decisions do most of the work:
 *
 *  - **The band.** Measuring full-range energy makes a score's bass and an
 *    explosion look exactly like a line of dialogue, and a film with a
 *    continuous score reduces to one enormous "speaking" interval with no
 *    onsets in it at all. Everything outside roughly 250–3000 Hz is discarded
 *    first, which is where speech lives and where most of a score does not.
 *  - **The threshold.** There is no absolute loudness that means "talking": a
 *    quiet chamber piece and an action film differ by twenty decibels. So the
 *    threshold is chosen by *duty cycle* instead — the caller names the fraction
 *    of the runtime that should count as speech, and the loudest that much of
 *    the film is what does. Which fraction is right is a property of the mix
 *    rather than of any constant, so the envelope is returned separately from
 *    the intervals and a caller can try several thresholds against one reading
 *    of the audio.
 *
 * FFmpeg produces the envelope in one pass, on a fixed grid, as plain text on
 * stdout. Nothing decodes audio in this process.
