/**
 * Where subtitles come from, and how a provider that wants a person is handled.
 *
 * The shape of this file is decided by one provider in particular.
 * TürkçeAltyazılar does not issue API keys; it issues short-lived sessions to a
 * browser that has passed a Cloudflare challenge. That has three consequences
 * which the rest of the subsystem has to be built around rather than patched
 * for later:
 *
 *  1. **A request can fail for a reason no retry fixes and no operator report
 *     helps.** The answer is a person completing a challenge in a window. So
 *     `needs-authentication` is a *result*, not an exception — the pipeline
 *     pauses on it and resumes the same attempt afterwards.
 *  2. **Session material is the most dangerous thing this subsystem holds.** A
 *     leaked cookie is somebody's account. So a session is unprintable by
 *     construction: it does not serialise, it does not appear in a template
 *     string, and the material is reachable only through a method that says so
 *     in its name.
 *  3. **The session belongs to a browser profile, not to this process.** Cookie,
 *     user agent and the storage that goes with them have to stay consistent or
 *     the far end sees a different client and challenges again. They therefore
 *     travel together as one object and are never assembled piecemeal.
 *
 * Explicit non-goals, because the absence of these is a design decision rather
 * than an omission: **no CAPTCHA solving, no challenge bypass, no fingerprint
 * or stealth evasion, and no long-lived hard-coded cookie.** The user completes
 * the challenge. This code carries the result of that and nothing else.
