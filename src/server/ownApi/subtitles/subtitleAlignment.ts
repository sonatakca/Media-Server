/**
 * Finding where a subtitle belongs on a film's timeline.
 *
 * The problem this solves is not translation and has nothing to do with text.
 * A subtitle and the thing it is timed against — another subtitle, or the
 * speech in the audio — describe the *same* pattern of silence and talking, and
 * that pattern is a fingerprint. A Turkish translation and an English one share
 * no words at all, but they start and stop within a few hundred milliseconds of
 * each other more than a thousand times, and no wrong alignment reproduces that.
 *
 * So both sides are reduced to the same thing: a run of intervals during which
 * somebody is speaking. Everything below works on those and never looks at a
 * character of dialogue, which is what lets one implementation serve a
 * reference subtitle in any language and a raw audio track equally.
 *
 * Two stages, for two different reasons.
 *
 *  - **A coarse cross-correlation** over a half-second grid, which is a global
 *    search: it will find a fourteen-second shift, or a PAL transfer's four
 *    percent, from no starting guess at all. It is deliberately blurred, so the
 *    peak is broad enough to survive a rate it has not exactly guessed, and
 *    therefore deliberately imprecise.
 *  - **An iterative fit** over cue onsets, which is a local search: given a
 *    starting point already within a second or so, it pairs each cue with the
 *    reference cue it must be, fits a line through the pairs, and repeats with
 *    a tighter tolerance. That is where the millisecond accuracy comes from,
 *    and it recovers a small rate error the coarse stage cannot resolve.
 *
 * The confidence that comes back is not a probability. It is the fraction of
 * the subtitle's own cues that land within a quarter of a second of a reference
 * cue under the proposed mapping, which is the thing an operator would check by
 * hand, and it is what decides whether the correction is offered at all.
