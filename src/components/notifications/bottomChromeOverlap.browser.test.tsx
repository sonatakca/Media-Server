 * renders into a portal on `document.body`, the pile is mounted by the app
 * shell — and they agree on the corner only through the reservation in
 * `lib/layout/bottomChrome`. That agreement holds trivially while both are
 * still. What it has to survive is the second in which one of them is arriving
 * or leaving and the other is travelling the lane it freed or took, which is
 * the only moment either can be laid out through the other.
 *
 * So this is sampled every frame across both transitions rather than asserted
 * at the two ends. A pair of boxes that miss each other before and after a
 * movement tells you nothing about the movement.
