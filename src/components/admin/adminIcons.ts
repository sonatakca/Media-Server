/**
 * The icon each registry section draws with.
 *
 * Resolved here rather than in the registry: the registry names an icon so it
 * can be read by a test, or by anything else, without pulling in an icon set.
 * Both the overview cards and the navigation resolve through this one map, so
 * a section cannot be drawn with one icon in the sidebar and another on its
 * card.
