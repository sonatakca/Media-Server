/**
 * The administration surface, as one list rather than several.
 *
 * Before this there were two descriptions of what administration contains: a
 * grid of cards on one page, and the route table. Adding a section meant
 * editing both, and forgetting either produced a link to nothing or a page
 * nobody could reach. This module is the description; the page renders it and
 * a test holds the route table to it.
 *
 * The translation keys are typed rather than left as strings, so a section
 * naming a key that does not exist fails to compile instead of rendering the
 * key to an operator.
 *
 * It is also grouped, which is the point of the exercise. Twenty equally
 * prominent cards are unreadable, and worse, they ask the reader to know which
 * subsystem owns a task before they can find it. The groups are errands
 * instead: the reader chooses between seven kinds of work, and the vocabulary
 * of the backend never has to be learned.
