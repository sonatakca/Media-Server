 * whoever occupies the corner publishes how much of it is taken, and the pile

 *

 * the number inside a calc(), the two components share no ancestor worth
 * threading a provider through, and a length on the document element crosses
 * the portal boundary for free.
 *
 * The value is a distance from the bottom edge of the viewport up to the top of
 * the occupying element, including whatever gap it wants kept above it — so it
 * can be compared directly against another element's `bottom` with max().
