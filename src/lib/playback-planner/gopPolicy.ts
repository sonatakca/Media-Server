/**
 * The one definition of "a two-second random-access interval" in Seyirlik.
 *
 * Two places need it and they must agree: the live transcoder builds a rolling
 * HLS playlist from a single encode, and the offline packager builds an aligned
 * ladder from several. If their GOP arithmetic drifted apart, the adaptive
 * ladder would still validate on its own — every rendition keyframed every two
 * seconds — while segment boundaries differed from anything the live path
 * produced, and the two would be silently incomparable.
 *
 * Encoder-specific arguments are decided here too, because they are not
 * interchangeable. `-sc_threshold 0` is an x264 private option that libx265
 * ignores with a warning; the equivalent lives in `-x265-params scenecut=0`.
 * QuickSync honours neither and needs `-forced_idr` for `-force_key_frames` to
 * emit an IDR rather than a plain I-frame — which a decoder cannot start on, so
 * a segment beginning there is not independently decodable at all.
