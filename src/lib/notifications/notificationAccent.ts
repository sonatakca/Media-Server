/**
 * What colour a notification card wears.
 *
 * Seyirlik's six accents are the six bars of the logo, and they run warm to
 * cool. The pile borrows that ramp whole and reads it as one scale: the warm
 * end is trouble, and the cool run is healthy work, ordered by how far through
 * the pipeline the job has travelled. A column of cards ends up looking like
 * the mark it belongs to, and the colour answers "which job is that?" before
 * the text is read.
 *
 * Status still outranks the job. A failure is red whatever produced it, and a
 * job that needs a person is amber whatever produced it: no family hue is ever
 * allowed to mute the two states somebody has to act on.
 *
 * Colour is never the only code here. The glyph carries the state, the card
 * names its own work, and the ramp itself steps down in lightness as it goes —
 * 11.4:1 at discovery to 4.5:1 at export — so the order survives being read
 * without colour at all.
