/**
 * The queue reorder gesture, in a real browser, on the real page.
 *
 * jsdom can prove that the model and the page agree; it cannot prove the thing
 * the operator complained about, because it has no layout and no pointer. Here
 * the cards have the heights the stylesheet actually gives them, the mouse is
 * a real mouse held down across several moves, and the assertions are the ones
 * you would make while watching over somebody's shoulder: the row you are
 * holding is the row that moves, nothing is left behind in its old slot, the
 * list rearranges before you let go, and what it showed you is what is saved.
 *
 * Chromium and WebKit both, because the gesture is pointer events and a
 * transform, and Safari is where this project's operators actually are.
