 * The book's sections as a window that moves with the reader: the sections on
 * screen, the one before and the one after, and whatever else lies within two
 * screens, are kept laid out and ready; the rest of the book is not in the page
 * at all. The bytes are the whole book, fetched once; what the window saves is
 * frames, layout and memory.
 *
 * epub.js's own continuous manager reaches for a section only when the reader
 * is 500px from the end of what is loaded, and tears a section's frame down as
 * soon as it is 500px off screen. Scrolling back therefore ran into empty space
 * (a whole screen of it while the section above was rebuilt) and then jumped
 * when it arrived. This one keeps the neighbours ready before they are needed,
 * and gives sections up only when the reader rests.
 *
 * Nothing that changes height may move the text being read. The block at the
 * top of the screen is the anchor: whenever any frame changes height (a section
 * added above, fonts landing, pictures loading, hyphenation), the anchor's
 * place in the book is measured again and the scroll moves by exactly what it
 * moved, before the frame is painted.
